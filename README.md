## Inertia React w/ Typescript

By default, if we use package like Laravel breeze, it'll use regular javascript react by default. But this project is for you who want to use inertia.js with typescript boilerplate.

## About Inertia.js

Inertia.js lets you quickly build modern single-page React, Vue and Svelte apps using classic server-side routing and controllers.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling.

## Available scripts
```bash
# Format with prettier
npm run format

# Start development
npm run dev

# Build the app
npm run dev

# Testing for SSR
npm run test-ssr
```

## Routing JS
This project has no routing plugin like [ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy), if you want a ziggy to this project. Please make a pull request.
